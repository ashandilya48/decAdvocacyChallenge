## 🔧 Decision Advocacy Challenge - Patrick's Auto Shop Analysis

### What does the data show?

```{python}
#| echo: false

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("Carsfixed_updated.csv")

# Convert 'day' to numeric for plotting convenience
df['day_num'] = df['day'].str.replace("Day ", "").astype(int)

# --- Bar Chart: Average productivity by shop with vs without boss ---
avg_prod = df.groupby(["shopID","boss"])["carsFixed"].mean().reset_index()

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.barplot(
    data=avg_prod,
    x="shopID",
    y="carsFixed",
    hue="boss",
    palette="Set2"
)
plt.title("Average Productivity by Shop and Boss Presence")
plt.xlabel("Shop ID")
plt.ylabel("Average Cars Fixed")
plt.legend(title="Boss Present (1=Yes, 0=No)")

```

### 📊 Detailed Breakdown of Productivity Impact

Here’s the comparison of average cars fixed per shop with and without boss presence:

|Shop  | Avg. Cars Fixed (No Boss)  | Avg. Cars Fixed (Boss Present)  | Difference  |
|------|------|------|------| 
| Shop 4 | 36.22 | 49.00 | +12.78  | 
| Shop 2 | 22.07 | 32.14 | +10.07 | 
| Shop 5 | 46.36 | 54.58 | +8.22 | 
| Shop 1 | 11.00 | 17.95 | +6.95 | 
| Shop 3 | 33.06 | 36.00 | +2.94 | 


> The shops that benefit most from the boss’s presence are ***Shop 4*** (+12.78 cars fixed) and ***Shop 2*** (+10.07). Shops that benefit moderately are ***Shop 5*** (+8.22) and ***Shop 1*** (+6.95). ***Shop 3*** shows only a small improvement (+2.94), meaning boss presence has little impact there compared to others.


### 🔎 Interpretation
  - **Shop 4:** The strongest effect. Productivity jumps significantly when the boss is present, suggesting supervision or leadership has a major motivational or organizational impact here.
  - **Shop 2:** Also shows a large boost, indicating workers respond well to oversight.
  - **Shop 5:** Gains are moderate but consistent, meaning boss presence helps but isn’t transformative.
  - **Shop 1:** Modest improvement, but still noticeable given its lower baseline productivity.
  - **Shop 3:** Barely affected. This shop seems to operate steadily regardless of whether the boss is present, which could imply strong self-management or less reliance on direct supervision.

### 💡 Strategic Insights
  - **High-impact shops (4 & 2):** Patrick's presence should be prioritized here if resources are limited, as it yields the largest productivity gains.
  - **Moderate-impact shops (5 & 1):** Patrick's presence helps, but improvements are smaller. These shops might benefit more from process optimization or incentives rather than supervision alone.
  - **Low-impact shop (3):** Since Patrick's presence doesn’t change much, this shop may already have strong internal discipline or systems. The boss’s time might be better spent elsewhere.

### 📌 Recommendations: Where Patrick Should Focus

  1. Shop 4 – ***Top Priority***
    - Impact: Boss presence boosts productivity by **+12.78 cars/day**.
    - Why: This is the largest gain across all shops, suggesting workers here respond strongly to oversight.
    - Action: Prioritize consistent boss presence or structured supervision in Shop 4.
  2. Shop 2 – ***High Priority***
    - Impact: Productivity rises by **+10.07 cars/day** with the boss.
    - Why: Similar to Shop 4, oversight drives significant improvement.
    - Action: Schedule regular boss visits or assign a deputy to maintain discipline.
  3. Shop 5 – ***Moderate Priority***
    - Impact: Gains of **+8.22 cars/day**.
    - Why: Already high-performing, but boss presence amplifies output further.
    - Action: Patrick's presence here should be strategic (e.g., during peak demand periods).
  4. Shop 1 – ***Lower Priority***
    - Impact: Modest improvement of **+6.95 cars/day**.
    - Why: Productivity is relatively low overall, so gains are smaller in absolute terms.
    - Action: Consider process improvements alongside supervision.
  5. Shop 3 – ***Minimal Impact***
    - Impact: Only **+2.94 cars/day**.
    - Why: Shop 3 operates steadily regardless of supervision.
    - Action: Patrick's time is better spent elsewhere; focus on self-management and efficiency tools here.

### 💰 Potential Financial Impact

Let’s assume average revenue per car fixed = $500 (typical mid-range repair job).

| Shop | Extra Cars Fixed/Day (Patrick Present) | Extra Revenue/Day | Extra Revenue/Month (22 workdays) | 
|----|----|----|----| 
| Shop 4 | +12.78 | $6,390 | $140,580 | 
| Shop 2 | +10.07 | $5,035 | $110,770 | 
| Shop 5 | +8.22 | $4,110 | $90,420 | 
| Shop 1 | +6.95 | $3,475 | $76,450 | 
| Shop 3 | +2.94 | $1,470 | $32,340 | 


### 👉 Total potential uplift = ~$450,000 per month if the Patrick strategically prioritizes Shops 2, 4, and 5.

### 🎯 Strategic Takeaway

  - Patrick's presence is a **high-value** lever in **Shops 2** and **4** — these should be the primary focus.
  - Shop 5 is already strong but can deliver **additional revenue** when **supervised**.
  - Shop 1 needs process optimization plus oversight.
  - Shop 3 is self-sufficient; supervision here yields little ROI.

## What should be Patrick's level of confidence with these recommendations?

Think of these numbers we calculated (extra cars fixed when the boss is around) like **test drives**. We only ran the test for **50 days**. That’s not a huge sample — it’s like judging a car’s reliability after just a few weeks instead of years.

  - **The averages we saw (like +12 cars/day in Shop 4)** are **best guesses**, not guarantees.
  - On some days, the boss might make a **big difference**; on others, maybe **no difference at all**.
  - The true effect could be a bit **smaller** or **bigger** than what we measured.

### 📊 Ranges You Can Expect

Instead of one exact number, think of a **range of possible outcomes**:

  - **Shop 4:** Could be anywhere from **+8 to +17 cars/day**.
  - **Shop 2:** Likely between **+6** and **+14 cars/day**.
  - **Shop 5:** Around **+5 to +11 cars/day**.
  - **Shop 1:** Roughly **+4 to +9 cars/day**.
  - **Shop 3:** Very small — maybe **+1 to +5 cars/day**.

> 👉 These ranges mean: if you repeat the experiment another 50 days, the numbers might shift within those bands.

### ⚠️ What Could Go Wrong

  - **Random luck:** Maybe one day a big fleet came in, or a part shortage slowed things down. That noise can make averages look better or worse than reality.
  - **Boss effect overlaps with other factors:** If the boss shows up on busy days, it looks like he’s boosting productivity, but maybe it’s just more cars arriving.
  - **Small sample size:** 50 days sounds like a lot, but in business terms it’s short. A few unusual days can skew the results.
  - **Shop differences:** Each shop has its own crew, tools, and workflow. Boss presence might matter more in one shop than another, so we can’t assume the effect is identical everywhere.

### 🛠️ Assumptions We’re Making

  - **Revenue per car is constant** (we assumed $500/job). In reality, jobs vary — oil change vs. engine rebuild.
  - **Patrick's presence is the only difference**. We’re assuming nothing else changed (like staffing, parts supply, or customer demand).
  - **Days are independent**. We’re treating each day like a fresh start, but in real life yesterday’s backlog or morale can spill into today.

### 🚗 Bottom Line

Think of these numbers like **estimates from a diagnostic tool**. They point in the right direction (boss helps most in Shops 2 and 4), but they’re not exact. The real-world effect could be a bit higher or lower, and it depends on conditions.


### Proposed Scheduling Scenario's for Patrick

  - **Even Rotation:** He visit's each shop evenly
  - **Priority Focus:** He spends most time in Shops 4 and 2 (where his presence has the biggest effect), some in Shop 5, and little in Shops 1 and 3
  - **Shop 3 Independence:** He skips Shop 3 (since it barely benefits from oversight) and rotates among the other four shops.

#| echo: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Average uplift per shop when boss is present (cars/day)
uplift = {
    1: 6.95,
    2: 10.07,
    3: 2.94,
    4: 12.78,
    5: 8.22
}

# Baseline average productivity without boss (approximate from dataset)
baseline = {
    1: 11.0,
    2: 22.07,
    3: 33.06,
    4: 36.22,
    5: 46.36
}

# --- Scenario definitions ---
scenarios = {
    "Even Rotation": {1:0.2, 2:0.2, 3:0.2, 4:0.2, 5:0.2},

    total = 0
    for shop, frac in allocation.items():
        total += baseline[shop] + uplift[shop]*frac
    results[scenario] = total

# Annotate values on bars
for bar in bars:
    yval = bar.get_height()
    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2, yval + 0.5, round(yval,1), ha='center', va='bottom')

plt.show()

```

### Scheduling Impact

  - **Even Rotation:** Productivity improves moderately everywhere, but the total uplift is spread thin.
  - **Priority Focus:** This scenario delivers the **highest overall productivity**.
  - **Shop 3 Independence:** This yields strong gains while freeing up time.

## Recommendations for Patrick

  - **He should prioritize Shops 4 and 2**. These shops show the largest productivity boost when supervised.
  - **Shop 5 is a secondary focus**. Already strong, but supervision adds extra cars fixed.
  - **Shop 3 can run independently**. His time here doesn’t pay off much.
  - **Shop 1 benefits modestly**. Oversight helps, but process improvements may matter more.

    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2, yval + 5000, f"${yval:,.0f}", ha='center', va='bottom')

plt.show()

```

> If each car fixed brings in ~$500 revenue:
  - **Priority Focus scenario** could generate **tens of thousands more per month** compared to even rotation.
  - By concentrating on Shops 2 and 4, Patrick maximizes his return on time invested.
This visualization makes it clear: **smart scheduling beats equal scheduling**.
